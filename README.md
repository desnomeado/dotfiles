# Hello

## Welcome to the worst dotfiles repostory you'll ever see.

these dotfiles are probably unusable outside of my machine, use them at your own risk

## But, since you're here

### Some information about my setup

Currently I'm using alpine linux as my primary operating system, specifically the edge version since the stable lack of packages.
other infos:

* Editor: neovim
* WM: awesome
* launcher: rofi
* terminal: xterm
* browser: firefox
* shell: zshell
* colorscheme: custom made, you can look at it on the Xresources file, it's highly inspired by onedark and palenight
